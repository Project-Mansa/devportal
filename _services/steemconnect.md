**SteemConnect** is an identity layer on top of the Steem blockchain that makes accounts secure

**How does SteemConnect work?**

SteemConnect gives you full access to the Steem ecosystem without giving up your private keys. Thatâ€™s right, never risk a malicious or incompetent 3rd party app getting your private keys again. SteemConnect acts as the identity layer in between that enables participation without vulnerability.

**What are the advantages of using SteemConnect?**

SteemConnect is a universal indentity management platform for the Steem blockchain. 3rd Party applications will create an application implementing SteemConnect so when users are required to authenticate applications they do so via SteemConnect. This not only protects the user's private keys but gives them the ability to revoke access should you require. You are in full control of all your keys.

**How does it work?**

For developers it allows you to create applications on the SteemConnect portal without having to worry about authentication. This is good news since users will be putting their trust in SteemConnect and you can just worry about building your application

For users, they will authorize your application via SteemConnect and feel secure that their private keys and passwords are 100%.
